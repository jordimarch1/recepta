  <h1>Apple Pie</h1> 
</header>

 <p>Was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one
quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place
prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!</p>

<h2>Directions</h2>
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in
flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce
temperature and let simmer.

Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a
lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
that it does not run off.



Directions

Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.
